{"about":"I'm a PhD candidate in Law at [University College\nLondon](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/). My research draws from ecology and evolutionary economics to ask how competition law can understand market competition as a process. I work as a graduate lecturer at the [UCL Laws](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/ucl-faculty-laws), where I also run the [Law and Political Economy Group](https://sites.google.com/view/ucl-lpe/home).\n\nI hold a master's degree in [Politics and\nTechnology](https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/politics-technology-master-of-science-msc)\nfrom the [Technical University Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) and a\nbachelor's degree in [Computer\nScience](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) from [The University of\nManchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk). I previously worked for six years as a software engineer at [Google](https://google.com), mostly in the security and privacy space.\n\nI'm interested in topics which ultimately impact human\nflourishing. In particular, virtue ethics and how social technologies can be a force for good in an age of metacrisis (surpassed planetary boundaries, increasing inequality, geopolitical strife, existential risk production, etc).",

It\u0026rsquo;s easier to be motivated when you like something. Things become more enjoyable when you get good at them.   We should aim for great things  We only get one life. It\u0026rsquo;s better to use it on significant things, rather than to \u0026ldquo;muddle through\u0026rdquo;. You can still enjoy something, even if you ultimately fail. Success is mostly about perspiration and luck. Luck favours the prepared mind.   Align yourself with the public interest  Your own interest is important. But it has diminishing returns. You can align your private interest with the public interest. Working in the public interest has a higher ceiling. Don\u0026rsquo;t underestimate your capacity to change the world!   We should think reflexively  It\u0026rsquo;s possible to critically assess your own thought patterns. This lets you improve how you think, and become a better person.   Think in systems  Problems often don\u0026rsquo;t have a direct cause. They have several or many interlocking causes. Challenges and responses \u0026gt; problems and solutions. Look to think synergistically across domains when responding to challenges. This is where magic happens.   Speed is important  You learn via receiving feedback from your actions. The quicker you execute, the more feedback you\u0026rsquo;ll generate. This is why we learn quickly while playing; there\u0026rsquo;s usually a rapid feedback loop.   Self discipline is delayed gratification  Delaying gratification is a form of self love. You must care enough for your future self to sacrifice your present self.   Avoid competition with others  Competition is great for honing a specific task. But the world is big and weird. There are many tasks we can do and roles we can play. Pick a unique bundle of skills. Excel at providing those skills to the world.   Compound returns isn\u0026rsquo;t just for money  Compound returns works on relationships, skills, knowledge, etc. For example, it\u0026rsquo;s easier to lean something if you already know related things. Invest early, and often! Most investments will make modest returns, some will give huge ones.   We should focus on what we can control  The only thing we can truly control is our thoughts and actions. We can\u0026rsquo;t even control our bodies. For example, we can get sick. Focus on what you can control, avoid worrying about what you can\u0026rsquo;t.   Don\u0026rsquo;t put off the good life  Putting things off is a trap; we might never get to them. You can be content in a surprising number of circumstances. You get to decide what the good life looks like. Pay attention to what matters.   Wisdom only correlates with age  Wisdom comes from distilling knowledge out of experience. Experience correlates with age. But it\u0026rsquo;s possible to live essentially the same year many times. It\u0026rsquo;s also possible to exist, but to not really live.   An intelligent mind is an inquiring mind  Our minds can only model the world. Models are always wrong, and always incomplete. We should resist being satisfied with our conclusions. We can watch, study, learn, and be ready to throw out our ideas when they\u0026rsquo;re wrong. \u0026quot;Study what interests [you] in the most irreverent, undisciplined and original manner possible\u0026quot;.
