{"about":"I'm a researcher and social technologist working on the governance of market economies. My work focuses on the intersection between competition law and complexity science, which I'm pursuing via a PhD in law at [University College\nLondon](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/) under [Prof. Ioannis Lianos](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/people/prof-ioannis-lianos).\n\nI hold a master's degree in [Politics and\nTechnology](https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/politics-technology-master-of-science-msc)\nfrom the [Technical University Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) and a\nbachelor's degree in [Computer\nScience](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) from [The University of\nManchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk). I previously worked as\na software engineer at [Google](https://google.com) for six years, mostly in the security and privacy space.\n\nI'm interested in topics which ultimately impact human\nflourishing. In particular, virtue ethics and how social technologies can be a force for good in an age of metacrisis (surpassed planetary boundaries, increasing inequality, geopolitical strife, existential risk production, etc).",
