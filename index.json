{"about":"I'm a PhD candidate in Law at [University College\nLondon](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/). My research draws from ecology to ask how competition law can understand market competition as a process. I work as a graduate lecturer at the [UCL Laws](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/ucl-faculty-laws), where I also run the [Law and Political Economy Group](https://sites.google.com/view/ucl-lpe/home).\n\nI hold a master's degree in [Politics and\nTechnology](https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/politics-technology-master-of-science-msc)\nfrom the [Technical University Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) and a\nbachelor's degree in [Computer\nScience](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) from [The University of\nManchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk). I previously worked for six years as a software engineer at [Google](https://google.com), mostly in the security and privacy space.\n\nI'm interested in topics which ultimately impact human\nflourishing. In particular, virtue ethics and how social technologies can be a force for good in an age of metacrisis (surpassed planetary boundaries, increasing inequality, geopolitical strife, existential risk production, etc). Here is a [list of things I believe](/beliefs). Here is a [list of cities I visited](/cities) with recommendations and photos.\n",
