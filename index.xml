      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD candidate in Law at University College London. My research draws from ecology and evolutionary economics to ask how competition law can understand market competition as a process. I run the Law and Political Economy Group at UCL Laws.
I hold a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Politics and Technology from the Technical University Munich and a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science from The University of Manchester. I previously worked for six years as a software engineer at Google, mostly in the security and privacy space.</description>

        <![CDATA[ <p>I&rsquo;m a PhD candidate in Law at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/">University College
London</a>. My research draws from ecology and evolutionary economics to ask how competition law can understand market competition as a process. I run the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ucl-lpe/home">Law and Political Economy Group</a> at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/ucl-faculty-laws">UCL Laws</a>.</p>
<p>I hold a master&rsquo;s degree in <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/politics-technology-master-of-science-msc">Politics and
Technology</a>
from the <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/">Technical University Munich</a> and a
bachelor&rsquo;s degree in <a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">Computer
Science</a> from <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk">The University of
Manchester</a>. I previously worked for six years as a software engineer at <a href="https://google.com">Google</a>, mostly in the security and privacy space.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in topics which ultimately impact human
flourishing. In particular, virtue ethics and how social technologies can be a force for good in an age of metacrisis (surpassed planetary boundaries, increasing inequality, geopolitical strife, existential risk production, etc).</p>
