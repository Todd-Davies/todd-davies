      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD candidate in Law at University College London. My research draws from ecology and evolutionary economics to ask how competition law can understand market competition as a process. I run the Law and Political Economy Group at UCL Laws.
I hold a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Politics and Technology from the Technical University Munich and a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science from The University of Manchester. I previously worked for six years as a software engineer at Google, mostly in the security and privacy space.</description>

        <![CDATA[ <p>I&rsquo;m a PhD candidate in Law at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/">University College
London</a>. My research draws from ecology and evolutionary economics to ask how competition law can understand market competition as a process. I run the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ucl-lpe/home">Law and Political Economy Group</a> at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/ucl-faculty-laws">UCL Laws</a>.</p>
<p>I hold a master&rsquo;s degree in <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/politics-technology-master-of-science-msc">Politics and
Technology</a>
from the <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/">Technical University Munich</a> and a
bachelor&rsquo;s degree in <a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">Computer

Manchester</a>. I previously worked for six years as a software engineer at <a href="https://google.com">Google</a>, mostly in the security and privacy space.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in topics which ultimately impact human
flourishing. In particular, virtue ethics and how social technologies can be a force for good in an age of metacrisis (surpassed planetary boundaries, increasing inequality, geopolitical strife, existential risk production, etc).</p>

      <description>Here is some stuff I believe, in no particular order.
 Work on stuff you like  Doing great work requires motivation It&amp;rsquo;s easier to be motivated when you like something Things become more enjoyable when you get good at them   We should aim for great things  We only get one life It&amp;rsquo;s better to use it on significant things, rather than to &amp;ldquo;muddle through&amp;rdquo; You can still enjoy something, even if you ultimately fail Success is mostly about perspiration and luck.</description>

        <![CDATA[ <p>Here is some stuff I believe, in no particular order.</p>
<ul>
<li>Work on stuff you like
<ul>
<li>Doing great work requires motivation</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s easier to be motivated when you like something</li>
<li>Things become more enjoyable when you get good at them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/530415.The_Art_of_Doing_Science_and_Engineering">We should aim for great things</a>
<ul>
<li>We only get one life</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s better to use it on significant things, rather than to &ldquo;muddle through&rdquo;</li>
<li>You can still enjoy something, even if you ultimately fail</li>
<li>Success is mostly about perspiration and luck. Luck favours the prepared mind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Align yourself with the public interest
<ul>
<li>Your own interest is important</li>
<li>But it has diminishing returns</li>
<li>You can align your private interest with the public interest</li>
<li>Working in the public interest has a higher ceiling</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t underestimate your capacity to change the world</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/reflexive-self-examination">We should think reflexively</a>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s possible to critically assess your own thought patterns</li>
<li>This lets you improve how you think</li>
<li>You can become a better person by doing this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/3828902">Think in systems</a>
<ul>
<li>Problems often don&rsquo;t have a direct cause</li>
<li>They have several or many interlocking causes</li>
<li>Challenges and responses &gt; problems and solutions</li>
<li>Look to think synergistically across domains when responding to challenges</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Speed is important
<ul>
<li>You learn via receiving feedback from your actions</li>
<li>The quicker you execute, the more feedback you&rsquo;ll generate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/startingfromnix/status/1607763222303756290">Self discipline is delayed gratification</a>
<ul>
<li>Delaying gratification is a form of self love</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13470.Think_on_These_Things">Avoid competition with others</a>
<ul>
<li>Competition is great for honing a specific task</li>
<li>But the world is big and weird</li>
<li>There are many tasks we can do and roles we can play</li>
<li>Pick a unique bundle of skills</li>
<li>Excel at providing those skills to the world</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/530415.The_Art_of_Doing_Science_and_Engineering">Compound returns isn&rsquo;t just for money</a>
<ul>
<li>Compound returns works on relationships, skills, knowledge, etc</li>
<li>E.g. The more things we know, the easier it is to learn more things</li>
<li>Continually invest in learning, people, etc</li>
<li>Most investments will make modest returns, some will give huge ones</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43566091-lessons-in-stoicism">We should focus on what we can control</a>
<ul>
<li>The only thing we can truly control is our thoughts and actions</li>
<li>We can&rsquo;t even control our bodies (e.g. we get sick)</li>
<li>Focus on what you can control, avoid worrying about what you can&rsquo;t</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97412.On_the_Shortness_of_Life">Don&rsquo;t put off the good life</a>
<ul>
<li>Putting things off is a trap; we might never get to them</li>
<li>You can be content in a surprising number of circumstances</li>
<li>You get to decide what the good life looks like</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97412.On_the_Shortness_of_Life">Wisdom only correlates with age</a>
<ul>
<li>Wisdom comes from distilling knowledge out of experience</li>
<li>Experience correlates with age</li>
<li>People are better/worse at extracting knowledge from their experiences</li>
<li>It is possible to exist but not really live</li>
</ul>
</li>
