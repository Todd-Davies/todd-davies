      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD candidate in Competition Law at University College London, and a Research Fellow of the Inclusive Competition Forum. My research asks how competition law can understand market competition as a process, drawing from theoretical ecology and systems theory to do so. I work as a graduate lecturer at the UCL Laws, where I also run the Law and Political Economy Group.
I hold a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Politics and Technology from the Technical University Munich and a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science from The University of Manchester.</description>

      <description>Please consider migrating away from Twitter/X and onto BlueSky. It&amp;rsquo;s a better platform, which isn&amp;rsquo;t owned and steered by an oligarch.
You can find my account here.
If you&amp;rsquo;re a competiton/antitrust law person, you can follow this ready-made list of accounts to get started.
If you&amp;rsquo;re a complexity science person, you could follow this list.
Happy posting!</description>

      <description>I used to post my school/university notes on here. I no-longer do because most of them are horrifically out of date. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, you&amp;rsquo;re welcome to look directly at the Git repos, which have the compiled pdf files in them.

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[We ask]: why can’t consumers choose which advertising network they would like to use with Google’s zero-priced online platforms? Our answer is that by integrating its advertising network into its popular online platforms, Google has foreclosed competition in the online advertising market by denying rival supply-side ad networks access to its customer base. We propose a remedy called marketised monetisation, which is complementary to the break-up proposed by the Commission. Marketised monetisation would introduce an interoperability layer between Google’s popular online services and third-party ad networks to make the online advertising market more contestable. The interoperability layer would allow consumers to choose which firm should monetise their usage of Google’s zero-priced products and services.</p>

      <description>Here are some things that I believe about how to live, in no particular order.
 Enthusiasm matters  Doing great work requires motivation. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to be motivated when you like something. Things become more enjoyable when you get good at them.   We should aim for significant things  We only get one life. It&amp;rsquo;s better to use it on significant things, rather than to &amp;ldquo;muddle through&amp;rdquo;. You can still enjoy something, even if you ultimately fail.</description>

        <![CDATA[ <p>Here are some things that I believe about how to live, in no particular order.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nat.org/">Enthusiasm matters</a>
<ul>
<li>Doing great work requires motivation.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s easier to be motivated when you like something.</li>
<li>Things become more enjoyable when you get good at them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/530415.The_Art_of_Doing_Science_and_Engineering">We should aim for significant things</a>
<ul>
<li>We only get one life.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s better to use it on significant things, rather than to &ldquo;muddle through&rdquo;.</li>
<li>You can still enjoy something, even if you ultimately fail.</li>
<li>You get to define what is significant.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re stuck, aim for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Max+Scheler+pyramid+of+values&amp;tbm=isch">&lsquo;sacred&rsquo; over &lsquo;utility&rsquo;</a>.</li>
<li>Success is mostly about perspiration and luck. Luck favours the prepared mind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s smart to align yourself with the public interest
<ul>
<li>Your own interest is important.</li>
<li>But it has diminishing returns.</li>
<li>You can align your private interest with the public interest.</li>
<li>The public interest has increasing returns, and more potential for signficance.</li>
<li>It feels good to work on something larger than yourself.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t underestimate your capacity to change the world!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/29568959">Self examination is important</a>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s possible to critically assess your own thought patterns.</li>
<li>This lets you improve how you think.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/3828902">Everything is a system</a>
<ul>
<li>The direct cause of a problem is sometimes misleading.</li>
<li>Look for the underlying systemic issues and their downstream effects.e</li>
<li>Challenges and responses &gt; problems and solutions.</li>
<li>Look to think synergistically across domains when responding to challenges.</li>
<li>This is where magic happens.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://nat.org/">Speed is important</a>
<ul>
<li>You learn via receiving feedback from your actions.</li>
<li>The quicker you execute, the more feedback you&rsquo;ll generate.</li>
<li>This is why we learn quickly while playing; there&rsquo;s usually a rapid feedback loop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97412.On_the_Shortness_of_Life">Wisdom only correlates with age</a>
<ul>
<li>Wisdom comes from distilling knowledge out of experience.</li>
<li>Experience correlates with age.</li>
<li>But it&rsquo;s possible to live essentially the same year many times.</li>
<li>Each &lsquo;repeated&rsquo; experience is likely to generate less feedback, and less wisdom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/startingfromnix/status/1607763222303756290">Self discipline is delayed gratification</a>
<ul>
<li>Delaying gratification is a form of self love.</li>
<li>You must care enough for your future self to sacrifice your present self.</li>
<li>Delayed gratifiation can be an end almost in itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97412.On_the_Shortness_of_Life">The Good Life is for now</a>
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, putting things off is a trap; we might never get to them.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, you can be content in a surprising number of circumstances.</li>
<li>You get to decide what the good life looks like.</li>
<li>Pay <a href="https://lithub.com/simone-weils-radical-conception-of-attention/">attention</a> to what matters.</li>
<li>There are several ways to train your attention. Meditation is a good one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13470.Think_on_These_Things">Competition is dangerous for individuals</a>
<ul>
<li>Competition is great for honing a specific task.</li>
<li>But there are relatively few winners and many more losers.</li>
<li>Losing a competition can entail a high opportunity cost.</li>
<li>The world is big and weird.</li>
<li>There are many tasks that need doing in the world.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/18050143">Develop a unique bundle of skills. Excel at them.</a></li>
<li>These skills define your niche.</li>
<li>A small enough niche has no competition, so you&rsquo;re always a winner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Competition is good for groups
<ul>
<li>Competition is great for honing a specific task.</li>
<li>The world is big and weird.</li>
<li>There are many tasks that need doing in the world.</li>
<li>Competition is a great way to figure out how to do them well.</li>
<li>Winners experience positive feedback and are likely to win again.</li>
<li>Competitions need counterveiling negative feedback loops to run indefinitely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/530415.The_Art_of_Doing_Science_and_Engineering">Compound returns isn&rsquo;t just for money</a>
<ul>
<li>Compound returns works on relationships, skills, knowledge, etc.</li>
<li>For example, it&rsquo;s easier to learn something if you already know related things.</li>
<li>Invest early, and often!</li>
<li>Most investments will make modest returns, some will give huge ones.</li>
<li>Play long term games with long term people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43566091-lessons-in-stoicism">We should focus on what we can control</a>
<ul>
<li>The only things we can truly control are our thoughts and actions.</li>
<li>We can&rsquo;t even control what happens to our bodies. For example, we can get sick.</li>
<li>Focus on what you can control, avoid worrying about what you can&rsquo;t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13470.Think_on_These_Things">An intelligent mind is an inquiring mind</a>
<ul>
<li>Our minds can only model the world.</li>
<li>Models are necessarily incomplete.</li>
<li>We should resist being satisfied with our conclusions.</li>
<li>We can watch, study, learn, and be ready to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5550.Perfectly_Reasonable_Deviations_from_the_Beaten_Track">irreverently</a> throw out ideas when they&rsquo;re wrong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kBoLVvoqVY">The world is in a state of metacrisis</a>
<ul>
<li>Metacrisis is the idea that humanity faces a set of overlapping and interlinked crises.</li>
<li>These crises may have discrete causes, but their production is systemic.</li>
<li>Working our way out of the metacrisis is a defining challenge of my generation.</li>
<li>Nihilism is bad.</li>
<li>Dedicate yourself to finding ways to thrive instead.</li>
<li>Again, if you&rsquo;re stuck, aim for <a href="https://consilienceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TRANSCRIPT_-The-Psychological-Drivers-of-the-Metacrisis.pdf">&lsquo;sacred&rsquo; over &lsquo;utility&rsquo;</a>.</li>
