      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a researcher and social technologist working on the governance of market economies. My work focuses on the intersection between competition law and complexity science, which I&amp;rsquo;m pursuing via a PhD in law at University College London under Prof. Ioannis Lianos.
I hold a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Politics and Technology from the Technical University Munich and a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science from The University of Manchester.

        <![CDATA[ <p>I&rsquo;m a researcher and social technologist working on the governance of market economies. My work focuses on the intersection between competition law and complexity science, which I&rsquo;m pursuing via a PhD in law at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/">University College
London</a> under <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/people/prof-ioannis-lianos">Prof. Ioannis Lianos</a>.</p>
<p>I hold a master&rsquo;s degree in <a href="https://www.tum.de/nc/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/politics-technology-master-of-science-msc/">Politics and
Technology</a>
from the <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/">Technical University Munich</a> and a
bachelor&rsquo;s degree in <a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">Computer
Science</a> from <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk">The University of
Manchester</a>. I previously worked as
a software engineer at <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> for six years, mostly in the security and privacy space.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in topics which ultimately impact human
flourishing. In particular, virtue ethics and how social technologies can be a force for good in an age of metacrisis (surpassed planetary boundaries, increasing inequality, geopolitical strife, existential risk production, etc).</p>
