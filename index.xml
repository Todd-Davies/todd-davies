      <description>Here are most of the notes that I made while studying for various exams. I&#39;m currently studying for a masters degree in Politics and Technology, and my notes should appear here when I&#39;ve finished courses.
Previous notes from my GCSE, A-level and Bachelors level examinations are here too. Please double check all information in them whilst revising, there&#39;s no guarantee that they are correct.
