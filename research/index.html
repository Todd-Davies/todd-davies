<p>My research focuses on how the law structures economnic competition in modern markets. In
particular, I'm interested in how complexity economics can provide a new view on markets which can help inform government interventions in market structure.</p>

<h2>Ongoing projects</h2>

<section>
    <b>Business Power and Investment Incentives: The United States in Comparative Perspective</b> (in-progress)

    <p>I'm part of a project which aims to examine the relationship
    between state aid to industry through investment incentives and
    the growing levels of market concentration in the United States
    and the European Union. The project is funded by
    the <a href="https://www.economicsecurityproject.org/">Economic
    Security Project</a>.</p>

<section>
    <b>Computational Antitrust: Modeling Marketization as a Regulatory
    Remedy using Agent-Based Computational Economics</b> (2021,
    in-progress)

    <p>I build an agent-based model to simulate how marketization
    changes the dynamics of monetized markets. I am able to recover
    stylized facts about the nature of such markets in the status quo,
    and model the effect of marketization should it be applied as a
    competition remedy.</p>

<section>
    <b><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3868332">Zero price, Zero Competition: How Marketization Fixes Anticompetitive Tying in Monetized Markets</a></b> (2021, forthcoming) - <a href="/">Todd Davies</a> & <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=3362990">Zlatina Georgieva</a>
    <p>This paper outlines why monetized (zero-priced) markets often tip towards a single dominant firm, and outlines a novel regulatory remedy by which such market failures can be prevented. This paper features in the <a href="https://law.haifa.ac.il/index.php/en/ascola">2021
        conference</a> for the <a href="https://ascola.org">Academic Society of Competition Law</a>.</p>
