<p>My research focuses on the process of competition in digital markets. In
particular, I'm interested in how the structure of markets and the actions of
    individual agents combine to create emergent behaviour.</p>

    <b>Computational Antitrust: Modeling Marketization as a Regulatory Remedy using Agent-Based Comptuational Economics</b> (2021, in-progress)

    <p>I build an agent-based model to simulate how marketization changes the dynamics of monetized markets. I am able to recover stylized facts about the nature of such markets in the status quo, and model the effect of marketization should it be applied as a competition remedy.</p>

    <p>This paper outlines why monetized (zero-priced) markets often tip towards a single dominant firm, and outlines a novel regulatory remedy by which such market failures can be prevented. This paper features in the <a href="https://law.haifa.ac.il/index.php/en/ascola">2021
