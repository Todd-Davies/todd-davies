      <description>Status: Incomplete, I need to visit more!
Food  TerraZen is a Caribbean &amp;amp; Japanese fusion place. It&amp;rsquo;s all vegan, good value and delicious. Men Impossible is a vegan ramen place. They have a five(!) course meal for 59 euros, which although on the expensive side for a meal, is an absolute steal for what you get. They have one big table in the middle of the restaurant, around which everybody sits.</description>

<li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/cZBQGpgnhCCeMpCK9">Margo&rsquo;s</a> is a delicious (vegan) bakery with a large selection of sweet and savoury things. They also do top notch coffee and other drinks.</li>
<li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/KjWpd1RcavpZYQzo9">FEBO</a> is on the list for novelty rather than quality. It&rsquo;s a fast food place where the food is pre-prepared and served by a vending machine style setup. No vegan options (I think?), but it&rsquo;s fun to try.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="fun">Fun</h1>
<ul>
<li>Walk around the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/zyJXuYmWCCeLrjzE9">Jordaan</a> district. I think it&rsquo;s the best part of Amsterdam; lots of canals, food options, good shops, etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/UN24HZn3hEJMt4Tg6">Wynand Fockink</a> is a historic liquour store. They have a quite unique set-up where the bartender will help you figure out which (combinations) of their very large selection of flavours to try.</li>
<li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/98em8SXcrmBgDFM28">Vondelpark</a> is worth a visit, if the weather is good.</li>
<li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/8kr56LsT3cVL5FJ6A">Melkweg</a> is a good club in Amsterdam.  They have lockers, food etc.</li>
<li>Rather than taking a canal tour, consider the free 15 minute ferry between <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/zBxa3DaZornQRSzt7">Amsterdam Central</a> and <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/eksdV3z6gGkvwZYq7">NDSM</a>. When you arrive, there&rsquo;s a beachside restaurant/bar <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/UywjDK3Uh78ops6Z8">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Netherlands has fantastic trains. It&rsquo;s a breeze to visit plenty of nearby cities which are amazing in their own right, including Delft, Leiden, Utrecht, etc.</p>

      <title>Notes on Rome</title>

Food  Maritozzo is kind of like a Roman sandwich. It’s traditional Roman food, so maybe worth a try while you’re in town. You can find some here. Negresco Ristorante Pizzeria have lovely staff and make delicious food. They were incredibly nice, and I ended up eating for free! El Maìz does delicious Venezuelan street food! They are 100% gluten free (because everything is corn) and have vegan options.</description>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/t1F5Y3ozm8gt87CQ8">Pantheon</a> is amazing. I&rsquo;ve not yet managed to get inside, though not for lack of trying (&hellip;you should buy tickets online).</li>
<li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/zcG4aEMx65g3oMK49">Galleria Alberto Sordi</a> is a very aesthetic shopping centre (the shops are closed for renovation as of 2023 but you can still look inside).</li>
<li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/JmFPaHs37331N4J5A">Borghese Gallery</a> houses many of the most famous artworks in Rome.</li>
<li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/EpN9YNVJnQJsDJi6A">Castel Sant&rsquo;Angelo</a> is a fortress which started out as a mausoleum. Again, I&rsquo;ve not yet been in, but would love to go!</li>
<li>The <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/dWgNQpe5VrZUSnaH7">Vatican/St. Peter&rsquo;s Basilica</a> is obviously worth a visit (although I also didn&rsquo;t go in, as of yet).
Parks</li>
<li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/QBSaqapoU3t2TCvy6">Villa Borghese</a> is a really pretty park with lots of busts of famous Italians which is fun to look around. The Borghese gallery is also here.</li>

<li>It&rsquo;s just one hour on the train to <a href="/cities/napoli/">Napoli</a>!</li>
